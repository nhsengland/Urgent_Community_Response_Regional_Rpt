### Getting Started

#### Installation

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

To clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/nhsengland/Urgent_Community_Response_Regional_Rpt`

### Usage

Code contains SQL query to pull data from UDAL warehouse.

You will need to create your own personal_creds.R file 

This will need to contain two variables

serv <- "{connection_string_to_warehouse}"
id <- "user_name@udal.nhs.uk"


#### Outputs
The output is a HTML report that shows analysis of reginal and local ICB performance and activty for UCR



#### Datasets
The dataset is in a UKHF table within UDAL and requires no additional access beyond stand NHSE access.

I will post a data cut in a .csv to support testing of this code in due course.
